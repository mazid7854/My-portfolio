export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am a proficient MERN stack developer with over two years of
                  hands-on experience in crafting full-stack web applications.
                  My core expertise includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and
                  Node.js, where Iâ€™ve developed scalable and high-performance
                  web solutions that address complex business requirements.
                  I am also skilled in API documentation using Swagger,
                  containerization with Docker, and deploying applications on
                  cloud platforms. Additionally, I have experience with JUnit
                  and Mockito for testing, ensuring the reliability and
                  robustness of the code. To enhance my technical skills and
                  broaden my backend knowledge, I have mastered System Design,
                  Java, and Spring Boot, enabling me to design and deploy
                  efficient and scalable systems.`;
